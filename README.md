Description
This project demonstrates basic operations on Python lists. The tasks include creating and modifying a list using common list methods like append(), insert(), extend(), pop(), and sort(), as well as finding the index of a specific element.

Steps Performed

Created an empty list called my_list.

Appended the elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list.

Inserted the value 15 at the second position.

Extended the list with additional elements [50, 60, 70].

Removed the last element from the list.

Sorted the list in ascending order.

Found and printed the index of the value 30.

Output
The program outputs the final sorted list and the index of the value 30.

Usage
Run the Python script to understand and observe how list operations work in Python.
